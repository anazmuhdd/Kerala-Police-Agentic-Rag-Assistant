Police in Malabar Region,"Prior to Tipu Sultan's occupation, Malabar was administered by Naduvazhis and Desavazhis using local chieftains. In the early 18th century, a primitive police force called 'Kolkars' maintained order. After Tipu's invasion, chaos ensued due to displaced rulers. Upon British takeover in 1810, Captain Watts trained 500 Armed Policemen who replaced existing forces. An additional 1600 Kolkars were later added. In 1816, a new system assigned village-level policing to Adhikaris, taluk-level to Tahasildars, and city-level to Police Amins—all under District Magistrates. Sepoys performed dual revenue and police roles. To address systemic flaws, military officers were appointed alongside a native police force consisting of 31 officers, 150 Sepoys, and 2 buglers. In 1921, Mr. Hitchcock established the Malabar Special Police modeled on the British Army, becoming its first Commandant. By 1932, it expanded to 16 companies."

Stress that children must report any weird or upsetting messages without fear of punishment or internet restriction. Make it clear that they are not to blame for others' inappropriate behavior. Set strict time limits for internet chat use and enforce them to prevent internet addiction. Teach children that people in chat rooms are always strangers regardless of familiarity and should not be fully trusted. Instruct them never to share personal information such as real names, schools, phone numbers, or addresses online. Do not allow children to remain unsupervised online for extended periods. Ensure chat time occurs when parents are present to check in regularly. Emphasize polite and respectful behavior during all online interactions. Reassure children that no one can harm them through the internet as long as they follow established rules. Take an active interest in your child’s online activities.

Aparajitha is Online - Online Harassment Grievance Redressal Mechanism,"""Aparajitha is Online"" is a quick response mechanism for the grievance redressal of online-based harassment of women and girls. Most such cases of online harassment go unreported due to societal pressures, fear of backlash, or because the offender may be a close acquaintance or relative using blackmail tactics. Victims often feel insecure or lack confidence in approaching the police. To address these challenges, a sensitive, technically robust, and swift response system has been established. The State-level oversight is handled by the Superintendent of Police (SP), Women Cell, who is also responsible for grievance redressal specifically related to online harassment complaints. At the local level, designated Women Circle Police Officers (WCPOs) and Women Sub-Circle Police Officers (WSCPOs), trained in cyber-related matters, manage complaints. Strict confidentiality regarding the identity of victims and their families is maintained to prevent victim shaming or further harassment. Complaints must be sent via email to aparajitha.pol@kerala.gov.in and will be forwarded to specially designated emails at the police station level, accessible only by authorized WCPOs/WSCPOs. These officers are supported by cyber cells at the police station, district, and state levels—including Hi-Tech Cells and Cyber Dome—for identification and location of offenders. Once identified, legal action can be pursued as necessary, with coordination between the Station House Officer (SHO), District Police Chief, and SP Women Cell. A dedicated helpline number is available for assistance: 9497996992. Last updated on Wednesday, 5th July 2023 PM."

Outcomes and Impact of CCSE Operations,"Through coordinated efforts, the CCSE has significantly disrupted the circulation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) in Kerala. Operation P-HUNT led to the identification of 126 individuals engaged in widespread distribution of child pornography, resulting in a drastic reduction in membership of related online groups—from 2 lakh to just 5,000. Coordinated raids across all 14 districts have led to approximately 210 searches, registration of 38 cases, and arrest of 42 individuals with evidence. Despite challenges such as difficulty in identifying victims and verifying CSAM sources, the CCSE has instilled fear among offenders by demonstrating successful tracking capabilities even on anonymous platforms. Recognition from ICMEC underscores the effectiveness of Kerala Police’s approach.

Crime Prevention Tips – House Theft,"Thefts are typically committed by young males seeking small, expensive items that can be quickly converted into cash. These crimes often occur in homes where residents are temporarily absent, happening both during the day and at night. Thieves usually select houses that are unoccupied, easily accessible, offer good cover, and have convenient escape routes. To prevent house theft, follow these steps: Keep doors locked and windows covered even during the daytime. Ensure all doors and windows are securely closed and locked before leaving. Install grills on windows and glass-paneled doors. Avoid walking alone at night. Inform neighbors of your absence and use lighting at exit points. Do not keep large amounts of cash or ornaments at home. Always identify visitors before opening the door. Never allow young children to open the door for strangers. Ask all representatives for proper identification."

Kerala Police has been the fountain head of several police reforms and innovative schemes in the country. A new Kerala Police Act enacted in 2011 was a guiding light for many other state police forces in the country to draft their own local Police Acts. The avant-garde provisions of the Act, which enable setting up of Police Establishment Board, Police Complaints Authority, State Security Commission, Police Welfare Bureau, Community Policing, etc., have given it a status of a modern day treatise on Policing philosophy."

Those unwilling to join either force were to be dismissed upon returning from Nagaland. However, 897 out of 971 members disagreed with this decision.

Tensions escalated in May 1968 when A-Company refused deployment to Bible Hill, leading to exemption from duties. The entire battalion engaged in protest actions. Disciplinary measures were initiated, and by September 1968, actions against 694 personnel were finalized.

Road Safety Tips for Two-Wheeler Riders,"Wearing a helmet significantly reduces the risk of head injuries. Studies show that only 24% of helmeted riders sustained head injuries compared to 56% without helmets. Neurological deficiencies occurred in 14% of helmeted riders versus 33% among unhelmeted ones. Helmets also reduce the force and torque on the neck during impacts and decrease dynamic head impact by 50%. When approaching uncontrolled junctions, ask yourself: Am I coming from a minor road to a major road? Can other drivers see me? Do I have an escape route? At controlled or signalized junctions, consider: Is the green light about to change? Do I have enough time to stop? Can the vehicle behind me stop safely? Before taking a bend or turn, check: How sharp is the curve? Is the sight distance sufficient? Is my speed appropriate? While overtaking, ensure: Is the vehicle ahead turning right? Is there adequate sight distance? Is there a fast-approaching vehicle on the right? If being overtaken, reflect: Am I uncomfortable with this maneuver? Have I signaled properly? Are multiple vehicles overtaking simultaneously? When passing parked vehicles, watch out for: Sudden opening of doors, pedestrians rushing out, or vehicles pulling out unexpectedly. Regarding positioning, always ask: Can I see and be seen clearly? Is traffic limiting my options? Is there enough space to stop safely?"
